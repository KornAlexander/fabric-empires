/**
 * Water.
 *
 * The single largest realism win available for the money. A flat blue plane
 * reads as plastic no matter how good the terrain is, because water is one
 * of the few materials people can judge instantly: it reflects the sky,
 * refracts what is under it, and moves.
 *
 * three's Water does the reflection with a real mirror pass, so the surface
 * shows the actual sky and the actual coastline rather than an approximation.
 * The one asset it needs is a normal map, which is generated here.

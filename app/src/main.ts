     * ending the turn next to a hostile city produced no raid on my own.
     *
     * That is the exact complaint the docblock below already records about
     * assault tactics, seen from the other side of the wall.
     *
     * `movesLeft: 1` rather than 0, unlike `spawnEnemyAdjacent`: this one has
     * to be able to act in the enemy phase that follows, or it just stands
     * there and the siege never happens.

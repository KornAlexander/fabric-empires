/**
 * The warning that comes before a defence question.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The order was wrong and it made the question feel arbitrary.** An
 * incoming raid was detected in the preview turn and the modal opened
 * immediately, so the first thing a player saw was a question, with the only
 * clue being one line in the log panel. Being asked to defend against an attack
 * you have not been shown is indistinguishable from being quizzed at random,
 * and the entire design rests on the opposite: who is marching on you tells you
 * what you are about to be tested on.
 *
 * So the attack is shown first, at the place it is happening, in the attacker's
 * colour, and the question follows. The banner deliberately stays up while the
 * question is answered: the faction is the reason for the topic, and hiding it
 * at the moment of asking would throw that away again.
 *
 * ⚠️ It therefore sits ABOVE the question's backdrop in the stack. The backdrop
 * is 72% black with a blur, so anything beneath it is dimmed to a quarter and
 * out of focus, which for a banner whose whole job is to be read is the same as
 * not showing it.

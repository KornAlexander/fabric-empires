/**
 * Cheat codes.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Every TYPED code here leaves `mastery` alone. The O+K chord does not.**
 *
 * This is a study tool wearing a strategy game. Its only real output is the
 * readiness figure and the Great Library behind it, and those are built from
 * spaced-repetition data about questions actually answered. A code that wrote
 * to mastery would hand somebody a green 82% and a false belief that they can
 * sit DP-600, which is a worse outcome than any amount of losing.
 *
 * So the codes in this file move Compute, armies, walls and turns. Not one of
 * them touches `mastery`, and the two that come near the exam are careful:
 *
 *   - `sitthepaper` opens the Proctor early. It does not answer the paper.
 *     You still take forty questions and you still have to pass them.
 *   - `iknowthis` completes the research you are funding, because that is a
 *     GAME gate (it unlocks units). It marks the topic known to the tech tree
 *     and leaves the Great Library untouched, so the topic still shows as
 *     unlearned in the place that matters.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`okay` is the exception, and it is deliberate.** Holding O and K while
 * a question is open picks the right answer and submits it, and that answer
 * counts exactly as if it had been known: it feeds the schedule, the Library
 * and the readiness figure. Alexander asked for it on those terms.
 *
 * This file used to promise the opposite, in this docblock and in the console's
 * help text. Both were rewritten rather than left standing, because a promise
 * the code no longer keeps is worse than no promise: the next reader has no
 * reason to doubt it.
 *
 * What is left is disclosure. Every use is appended to `state.cheatsUsed`,
 * which lives in the save, so an empire built with help says so on the victory
 * screen and keeps saying so after a reload.

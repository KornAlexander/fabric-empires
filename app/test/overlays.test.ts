/*
  Overlay focus behaviour.

  This is a regression guard for a bug that bit twice in one session, in two
  unrelated files, for the same reason.

  A full-screen overlay whose card is taller than the screen has to scroll.
  The moment it scrolls, a plain `element.focus()` becomes a scroll command:
  the browser brings the focused element into view, and in every one of these
  dialogs the thing we focus for keyboard users is the button at the BOTTOM.
  So the dialog opens showing its own last line.

  Measured on the deployed build before the fix:
    - setup screen at 900x700 opened at scrollTop 1086 of 1786, hiding the
      title, the blurb and the whole "if you only have five minutes" box;
    - an answered question at 390x700 is 811px tall in a 700px viewport, and
      focusing Continue put the modal top at -127, so the player was shown the
      bottom of the explanation at the exact moment they should have been
      reading the verdict.

  The fix is always the same shape: focus({ preventScroll: true }), then put
  the scroll position back where the reader should start. This test only
  checks the first half, because that is the half that is mechanical.

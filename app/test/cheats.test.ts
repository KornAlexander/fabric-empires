/**
 * Cheat codes.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The assertion this file exists for is the last one: no cheat writes to
 * mastery.** Everything else here is ordinary behaviour checking. That one is a
 * promise about what the product is. Fabric Empires exists to tell somebody
 * whether they are ready to sit DP-600, and a code that could move that figure
 * would make the whole thing worse than useless, because the person would act
 * on it.
 *
 * It is tested by reading the source rather than by calling the functions,
 * because the failure mode is a future cheat that nobody thought to test.

 * quality rating and a clock, and returns the next record. That makes it
 * testable on its own, which matters because scheduling bugs are invisible in
 * a single session and only show up weeks later as an item that either never
 * comes back or comes back constantly.
 *
 * The algorithm is Piotr Wozniak's SM-2, which is the one behind most open
 * source flashcard tools. It is old, simple and good enough; the interesting
 * design decisions here are the two around it, namely how a game score maps
 * onto a quality rating and how intervals behave inside a single sitting.

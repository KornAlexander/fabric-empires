/**
 * The Great Library: what the player actually knows.
 *
 * A model, not a screen. Everything here is pure and synchronous so the
 * honest-reporting rules can be unit tested rather than eyeballed in a
 * browser, which matters because this is the one surface whose entire job is
 * to tell the truth about the learner's progress.
 *
 * Two temptations are refused on purpose.
 *
 * The first is counting skills instead of exam weight. Branch B is 18 of the
 * 41 skills but 45 to 50 percent of the exam, so "29 of 41 known" and "ready
 * for the exam" are very different claims. The weighted figure is the one a
 * learner should plan around.
 *
 * The second is treating researched as known. Unlocking a node in the tech
 * tree means a question was answered once. Retention is what `MasteryBand`
 * measures, and the two are reported separately rather than blended into one
 * flattering number.

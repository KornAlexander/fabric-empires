/**
 * Research.

 * The tech tree is supplied by the challenge provider as an opaque

 * Completing a node is deliberately a two-step affair: the turn pipeline
 * reports a node as READY, the app presents a challenge, and the result is fed

 * engine, and it means a failed challenge is a delay rather than a wall, which
 * is the intended feel: you keep the invested Compute and try again.

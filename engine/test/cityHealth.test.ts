  A city's health, and the fact that it is permanent.

  city's hit points. Promotion raises the ceiling and keeps the damage, so a
  town chipped in turn twelve is still chipped at the end of the game. A player
  who cannot see the number has no way to know that a raid they shrugged off
  cost them something they will never get back.

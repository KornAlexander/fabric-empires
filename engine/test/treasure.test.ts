/**
 * Buried caches.
 *
 * ⚠️ The rule worth defending here is the one that is easy to "simplify" later:
 * a wrong answer SHRINKS the chest rather than emptying it or leaving it whole.
 * Both of the obvious alternatives are worse, and neither failure is visible in
 * a screenshot:
 *
 *   - emptied, and one missed question is punished permanently, in a tool whose
 *     entire purpose is to be somewhere you are allowed to not know things;
 *   - untouched, and the question is free to retry, so it stops being a
 *     question and becomes a dialog to click through until it opens.
 *
 * The tests below therefore pin the SHAPE of the curve, not just its endpoints:
 * a retry has to be worth making, and grinding has to terminate.
